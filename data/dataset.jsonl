They do not care at all about our trainings, they do not find it worth seeing, they do not even read the emails from our department. I feel \"nice to have\" instead of a \"need to have\" in this organization. Not only operations put effort in their business, but we as the support departments do the same. It is disappointing to see that our efforts are not seen and appreciated."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for sharing those feelings. It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of frustration, disappointment, and a sense of being undervalued. You feel that the managers don't see the importance of the training and, by extension, don't appreciate the effort you and your department put into these initiatives. This lack of recognition and engagement makes you feel like your work is seen as optional rather than essential.\n\nNow that we've identified these unexpressed thoughts and feelings, let's explore the deeper truths and fundamental values that are being affected here. This step helps us understand the core issues at play.\n\nWhat do you think are the underlying values or truths that are being challenged by this situation? For instance, do you value recognition, collaboration, or perhaps the importance of professional development? How do these values relate to your feelings of being undervalued and unappreciated?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, I value recognition, collaboration and the professional development. When I do not see the comeback of what I have given and put effort on, I lose my motivation to continue doing the work and to strive for more."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's clear that recognition, collaboration, and professional development are core values for you. When these values aren't upheld—when your efforts aren't recognized, when collaboration with the managers is lacking, and when the importance of professional development isn't acknowledged—it understandably impacts your motivation and drive.\n\nThis deeper understanding of your values helps us see why the managers' lack of responsiveness is so disheartening. It's not just about the logistics of getting people enrolled; it's about feeling that your work and the principles you stand for are not being respected or valued.\n\nBefore we move on to the next step, which involves distinguishing between facts and thoughts, and understanding the ladder of inference, do you feel satisfied with our exploration of your unexpressed thoughts, feelings, and the deeper truths behind them? Is there anything else you'd like to add or clarify?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "yes, all good so far"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great, I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's move on to understanding the difference between facts and thoughts, and we'll explore the ladder of inference. This concept helps us see how we move from observing facts to making decisions, often adding our personal opinions and assumptions along the way.\n\nTo start, let's identify the facts in your situation. Facts are objective and observable. For example, a fact might be \"Only 40% of the target audience has enrolled in the training.\"\n\nNext, let's look at the thoughts and assumptions you might be adding to these facts. Thoughts are subjective and can include interpretations, assumptions, and judgments. For instance, a thought might be \"The managers don't care about our training.\"\n\nCan you share some specific facts about the situation, and then some of the thoughts or assumptions you might be adding to those facts? This will help us see how the ladder of inference is at play in your situation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "My emails and reminders were not answered, they are left unresponded, and there is no progress on the number of the enrolled participants. My assumption is either they are busy or they do not see value in attending or enrolling their team members to these sessions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You've clearly identified some key facts: your emails and reminders were not answered, and there has been no progress in the number of enrolled participants. These are objective observations.\n\nYour assumptions are that the managers might be too busy or that they don't see the value in attending or enrolling their team members in the sessions. These thoughts are subjective and based on your interpretation of the situation.\n\nThis is a great example of the ladder of inference. You start with observable data (unanswered emails and low enrollment), then move up the ladder by adding your interpretations and assumptions (they are busy or don't see the value).\n\nUnderstanding this process helps us see where our personal biases and assumptions might influence our perceptions and reactions. It also opens up possibilities for other interpretations that we might not have considered.\n\nBefore we move on to discussing how to have a productive conversation and understand the other person's perspective, do you feel comfortable with this distinction between facts and thoughts? Is there anything more you'd like to explore about the ladder of inference?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I feel comfortable with this distinction between facts and thoughts, nothing else to add, thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's focus on how to have a productive conversation with the managers and understand their perspectives, while also sharing your thoughts openly.\n\nWhen approaching this conversation, it's important to stay receptive to their viewpoints and communicate your own thoughts and feelings clearly. Here are some strategies to consider:\n\n1. **Start with the facts:** Begin by stating the objective facts, such as the low enrollment numbers and the lack of responses to your emails. This sets a neutral tone for the conversation.\n\n2. **Share your perspective:** Explain how these facts have affected you and your work. Use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and concerns without sounding accusatory. For example, \"I feel undervalued when our training sessions don't get the attention they need.\"\n\n3. **Invite their perspective:** Ask open-ended questions to understand their side of the story. For instance, \"Can you help me understand what challenges you might be facing in enrolling your team members?\"\n\n4. **Collaborate on solutions:** Work together to find ways to improve the situation. This could involve brainstorming ideas on how to make the training more appealing or finding better ways to communicate its importance.\n\n5. **Express appreciation:** Acknowledge their efforts and thank them for their time and input.

It might have been seen as patience and empathy, but it could also have been perceived as a lack of support or understanding if not coupled with verbal reassurances. The senior developer's feeling of being attacked suggests she might have been experiencing stress or pressure, possibly from juggling multiple responsibilities, like a second job, or other personal issues.\n\nIn your opinion, do you think the tech lead's approach was effective in creating a safe space for the senior developer to open up? And do you think the senior developer had any specific unspoken thoughts or feelings that might have been crucial to understanding her situation better?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "well the approach was effective at least trying to give the senior dev space to clarify.

Here are a few steps I might take:\n\n1. **Acknowledge Feelings**: Start by acknowledging that the conversation might be difficult and that the intention is not to attack but to understand and support. For example, \"I understand this might feel like a tough conversation, but my goal is to understand what's going on and how we can support you better.\"\n\n2. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Encourage the senior developer to share more about her experience and feelings. Questions like, \"Can you help me understand what challenges you're facing during on-call rotations?\" or \"Is there anything outside of work that might be affecting your performance?\"\n\n3. **Express Empathy**: Show empathy and understanding. If the senior developer shares any personal struggles, acknowledge them and express a willingness to help. For example, \"I can see how that would be really challenging. Let's figure out how we can make this work better for you.\"\n\n4. **Offer Support**: Discuss potential solutions or support systems that could help improve the situation. This could include adjusting on-call schedules, providing additional resources, or offering flexibility if personal issues are affecting work.\n\n5. **Follow-Up**: Ensure that this isn't a one-time conversation.

One approach could be to start with a pilot phase where we closely monitor the impact of this new role on our operations and costs. We can set specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness and ensure it aligns with our cost-cutting goals. Additionally, I'm open to discussing any adjustments or alternative solutions that you think might work better.\"\n\n**Client:** \"That makes sense.

The facts highlight the procedural gap, while your thoughts and assumptions reveal your concerns about the meeting's effectiveness and your ability to respond appropriately.\n\nDoes this help clarify the situation for you?

For example, you could say something like:\n\n\"I appreciate the urgency and the need to move quickly, but I've found that when we follow the established process, it helps us ensure that we have a well-thought-out strategy and the necessary approvals.

Managing emotions and frustration during a difficult conversation can be challenging but is crucial for maintaining a productive and respectful dialogue. Here are a few strategies to help you stay calm and focused:\n\n1. **Prepare and Practice:** Before the meeting, take some time to practice what you want to say. This can help you feel more confident and less emotional. You can even practice with a trusted colleague or friend to get feedback.\n\n2. **Focus on Facts and Solutions:** As we've discussed, separating facts from thoughts can help you stay grounded. Stick to the observable facts and focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on the problems.\n\n3. **Use \"I\" Statements:** Frame your concerns using \"I\" statements to express how the situation impacts you without sounding accusatory. For example, \"I feel unprepared when the process isn't followed, and it affects my ability to manage my workload effectively.\"\n\n4. **Take Deep Breaths:** If you start to feel overwhelmed or frustrated during the conversation, take a few deep breaths to calm yourself. This can help you regain composure and think more clearly.\n\n5. **Stay Open and Curious:** Approach the conversation with a mindset of curiosity and openness. Ask questions to understand the other person's perspective and show that you are willing to collaborate on finding a solution.\n\n6. **Pause if Needed:** If emotions start to run high, it's okay to suggest a brief pause. You can say something like, \"I think we all need a moment to gather our thoughts. Can we take a short break and then continue?\"\n\nWould you like to practice any specific part of the conversation or explore any of these strategies further?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "no thank youy"}]}, "outputs" : {"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're very welcome!

This left you wondering if their request was driven by deeper feelings of discontent, which added to your concern about potentially not meeting their expectations.\n\nIt's important to differentiate between what was actually said and what might be your assumptions. Let's delve deeper into these unexpressed thoughts and feelings. What do you think might be the deeper truth or fundamental values affected here?

You sensed that the team member might be dissatisfied with their current state, even though they didn't explicitly say so.

Here's a brief overview:\n\n1. **Observable Data**: The raw facts or data we see or hear.\n2. **Selected Data**: The specific data we pay attention to.\n3. **Interpreted Data**: The meaning we assign to the data.\n4. **Assumptions**: The beliefs we form based on our interpretations.\n5. **Conclusions**: The judgments we make based on our assumptions.\n6. **Beliefs**: The broader beliefs we form based on our conclusions.\n7. **Actions**: The actions we take based on our beliefs.\n\nIn ABC's case, the observable fact is that the bonus component is effective from the middle of the year. Her selected data might be her start date in April 2024 and the bonus structure in her previous account. She interprets this as unfair, assumes that her contributions are not being recognized, concludes that the company does not value her efforts, and believes that this is inconsistent with her expectations.

This involves sharing thoughts openly and staying receptive to others' viewpoints.\n\nHere are some strategies for having a productive conversation with ABC:\n\n1. **Acknowledge Her Feelings**: Start by acknowledging her feelings of dissatisfaction and the reasons behind them. This shows empathy and understanding.\n\n2. **Share Your Perspective**: Explain the rationale behind the timing of the bonus component. Be transparent about any constraints or policies that influenced this decision.\n\n3. **Invite Her Input**: Ask ABC for her suggestions on how the bonus structure could be improved. This makes her feel valued and involved in the process.\n\n4. **Stay Open and Receptive**: Be open to her feedback and willing to consider adjustments if possible. Show that you are committed to finding a fair solution.\n\n5. **Clarify and Align Expectations**: Ensure that both of you have a clear understanding of the bonus structure and any future changes. Align expectations to avoid similar issues in the future.\n\nWould you like to practice how you might start this conversation with ABC?

This will help us distinguish between what is objectively happening and the interpretations or assumptions we might be making.\n\nTo start, let's identify the facts in your situation. Facts are observable and verifiable pieces of information. For example, \"Information about salaries was leaked online\" is a fact. On the other hand, thoughts are your interpretations or assumptions about those facts, like \"The company doesn't recognize me the same way as my peers.\"\n\nCan you list some of the key facts in your situation?

You are in charge of a core piece of the project that involves you and other teams.\n\nThese are all objective, verifiable pieces of information.

For example, one thought might be, \"The company doesn't recognize my contributions as much as my peers' contributions.\" Another might be, \"I might need to leave the company if things don't change.\"\n\nCan you identify any other thoughts or assumptions you have based on these facts?

They reflect your feelings of being undervalued and the perceived lack of fairness in how your contributions are recognized and compensated.\n\nNow, let's introduce the concept of the ladder of inference. This concept helps us understand how we move from observing facts to making decisions, often adding our personal opinions and assumptions along the way. The ladder of inference has several steps:\n\n1. **Observing data and experiences**: These are the raw facts.\n2. **Selecting data**: We focus on certain pieces of information.\n3. **Adding meaning**: We interpret the data based on our experiences and beliefs.\n4. **Making assumptions**: We make assumptions based on the meanings we've added.\n5. **Drawing conclusions**: We come to conclusions based on our assumptions.\n6. **Adopting beliefs**: We form beliefs based on our conclusions.\n7. **Taking actions**: We act based on our beliefs.\n\nFor example, you observed the fact that salaries were leaked and that you earn less than some of your peers and the people you manage. You might select the data that you have more people under your supervision and are in charge of a core piece of the project. Adding meaning, you might interpret this as your work not being visible or valued. You then make the assumption that you are not fairly compensated and that bosses don't measure the amount of work thrown your way. This leads you to the conclusion that the company doesn't recognize your contributions, forming the belief that you might need to leave if things don't change, and potentially leading to the action of having this conversation with your boss.\n\nDoes this make sense to you? Do you see how the ladder of inference applies to your situation?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "somehow, yes"}]}, "outputs" : {"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great, I'm glad it makes some sense. The ladder of inference can be a bit abstract at first, but it's a useful tool for understanding how we move from facts to actions by adding our own interpretations and assumptions.\n\nNow that we've explored the facts and the thoughts built on those facts, let's focus on how to have a productive conversation with your boss. The goal is to share your thoughts openly while staying receptive to your boss's perspective.\n\nHere are some key points to consider for a productive conversation:\n\n1. **Start with the facts**: Begin by sharing the objective facts you've identified.

Be honest but also respectful.\n3. **Connect to your core values**: Explain how this situation affects your sense of fairness and feeling valued.\n4. **Stay open and curious**: Be prepared to listen to your boss's perspective and understand their point of view.\n5. **Seek a collaborative solution**: Aim to work together with your boss to find a solution that addresses your concerns.\n\nWould you like to practice how you might start this conversation, or is there a particular part of the conversation you feel uncertain about and would like some guidance on?"}}}

Now, let's consider the thoughts and assumptions that might be layered on top of these facts. For example, you might think that the VP doesn’t care about losing tenured team members, or that your voice isn’t respected.\n\nCan you identify any other thoughts or assumptions you might have about the situation?

Here are some key strategies:\n\n1. **Start with the facts:** Begin the conversation by presenting the observable facts. This helps to ground the discussion in objective reality and can make it less likely for the VP to become defensive.\n\n2. **Express your concerns and values:** Share your unexpressed thoughts and feelings, and explain the fundamental values that are being affected.

This could involve discussing any obstacles he's facing and how you can support him in meeting the expectations.\n\n6. **End on a Positive Note**: Reinforce your appreciation for his contributions to the team and express your confidence in his ability to improve.
